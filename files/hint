Yes, this is a terminal. But before you type any command here, please read some facts here:
 - This is just a sandbox. The only thing valuable here is YOUR OWN code.
 - We have NO backup for your code. If you delete some file here, nobody will be able to get it back.
 - This sandbox WON'T be reset when you log out.
 - This sandbox WON'T be reset even if you know the password of this sandbox and manually shut it down.
So BE CAREFUL!
